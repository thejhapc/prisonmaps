# prisonmaps
For making a map of all the prisons in IL 
Included in this repository is a list of all the prisons in Illinois that we conduct visits at.(prisons_visits) I included the lattitude and logitude and the distance from the JHA offices. You can find an IL shapefile at https://clearinghouse.isgs.illinois.edu/data/reference/illinois-state-boundary
If there is a better shapefile out there, please use it! 

Requests
1. Please create a map of IL where each prison is marked and color coordinated by distance from JHA's office. Green for two hours and under, yellow for between 3 and four and red for over 4 hours. 
2. Somewhere on the map, please include the phrase "Travel times may vary based on route taken and time of day." 
3. If possible please make the map interactive with the user's ability to filter by travel time. We can talk about how to do this, where to host it and the best way to go about it, our website is on squarespace (thejha.org) so you can let me know what you think is possible
4. Please use a Jupyter notebook and thoroughly explain your code so that another person can pick up from where you left off**


** we are a small non-profit and a lot of our data work is done by interns or volunteers with varying experience levels, the better-explained your work is, the easier it is for me to assign it to someone else when you leave.
